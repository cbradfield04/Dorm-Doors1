Collaboration Memo

Group Members: Cole Bradfield and Zoë Wilson and Allison Myers

**Week 4** 

January 31st

We discussed the topic of our project. We decided to do dorm door decorations and talk about the different ways that students express themselves through decorating their dorm doors. We talked about how we are going to do this project. For example, we are going to ask someone if we can take a picture of their door and then ask them questions on why they decorated it this way.
 
February 2nd

Talking over the Exhibition Proposal. Discussion on what references we need for our project. Also trying to decide what to name our project. At the moment, “Dorm Doors at IU” is the working title. We also worked a little on the proposal together and talked through the logistics of the project while doing so.


**Week 5** 

February 7th

none

February 9th

Talk about our next step for the project. We decided that we should probably start collecting pictures and interviews soon. 

**Week 6**

February 14th

We discussed how we will try to finish collecting photos and how we will go about doing that. We discussed sending info into our floor GroupMes to inform people we will be taking pictures of their doors. We also talked about if we need to interview everyone whose door we took pictures of and decided that if a person does not want to be interviewed, then it is okay. 

February 16th

We decided we will try to get all pictures by next class to start working on the website. 


**Week7** 

February 21st

We all decided to share our pictures on a Google folder. We all got our pictures but we only have 11 in total so we will try to see if we can get pictures from other floors in order to reach our goal of at least fifteen pictures for the exhibition. 

February 23rd

no class 

**Week 8** 

February 28th

We have all the pictures, we just need to add them all to the google drive folder. We decided we will try to collect all the interviews for the project as soon as possible. 

March 2nd

We are still working on gathering our interviews. The metadata has been started as well and we talked about how it is coming along. 


**Week 9**

March 7th

We talked about how we will continue to take interviews. We also talked about the metadata and how it is starting to come together well.

March 9th

We talked more about how the metadata is coming along. 

**Week 10** Spring Break

**Week 11** 

March 21st

We talked about how we will be renaming our files to make them easier to find. We decided we will name them datelocationpic# to make them easier to find. Cole shared the Metadata Record template so we could all add to it and make sure all the information is correct.              

March 23th

We talked about how we will try to finish collecting all our interviews soon.                                    

**Week 12** 

March 28th

We decided to add a new column to the metadata titled “Quotes” where we can add a sentence from the interview to describe the door. If we do not have an interview from someone, we will just write “N/A”. We also decided to label all our pictures on the Metadata as Location door #. We changed the file name of our images to match our pid. We changed them to obj#.                         

March 30th

We submitted our metadata record. Our finalized topic question is why and how do college students decorate their dorm doors. We structured the images so that there would be a quote answering this question from the person who decorated that door. 
Finalized topic question:
Image structure in response: 

**Week 13** 

April 4th

We looked over the feedback left on the Metadata Record. We are trying to decide what kind of changes we want/might make on the metadata. 

April 6th

We are going to use the object_type column to sort by what is on the pictures, for example we will sort by message board, images, and hanging decorations. We decided not to do image analysis because we feel like we saw the door decorations the same way as the owners, so we thought the column might be repetitive. 

**Week 14** 

April 11th

Feedback on Metadata: “Great! I think it'd be interesting to do a few extra things: 1 make use of the object_type column -- notice that this is sortable in the sample project 2 do some image analysis for the door deco and see what kind of info does the deco put on, text? image? both? none? any arrangement that made you wowed? this may be helpful for you to order the images 3 compare your image analysis with the quotes - how the deco owner sees the deco - does the owner see the message in the same way as others who pass by?”

April 13t

We used the object_type column to sort by what decorations are on the doors. We decided not to compare our image analysis with the quotes, since a lot of our descriptions were very similar to what the door owner thought.

**Week 15**

April 18th

We worked on setting up the website. Cole went through the steps to make sure our website was working. We also wrote the about page for our project. We talked about why we decided to do this project and what we learned from it. 

April 20th

We all created Github accounts so we could have access to the Github repository. We updated the credits for our site to say our names and the role we took in the project. We decided for the exhibits option, we will only do one exhibit.  

**Week 16** 

April 25th

We added a sentence-long description to the bottom of our webpage. We also added our copyright tag. We also added our paragraph-long description to the homepage of our webpage. We also updated the reuse page and wrote how our metadata table can be reused for future projects. We also wrote the exhibits section and wrote about messageboards and communication found from our dorm doors. We added to the browse section and wrote how and why we took the images for our project. We finished our website.

April 27th

We submitted the collaboration memo.
