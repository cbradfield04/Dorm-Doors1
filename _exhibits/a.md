Many of the doors in this collection feature a messageboard, which may include a survey, a question or a statement. Including a message on a dorm door is an efficient way to communicate with neighbors or passersby, without having to be face-to-face.

Within our collection, the majority of doors with messages come from Forest. Many of these are a question or survey that request participation from other floor members or visitors. Forest Door 2 has a message board saying "Draw a pretty picture!" which allows people to share a fun image that can spread positivity or laughter to those who walk by or to the room owners themselves.

In the image above, there is a countdown to Spring Break that was at 20 days when the picture was taken. As a passerby myself on this floor, I saw this countdown decrease every day, and it now shows the amount of days until school is out. The effect of this message is that it spreads enthusiasm about the upcoming break among peers. It also grounds people in the way that they might not have realized that they are already in the homestretch.
