Many of the doors in this collection feature a messageboard, which may include a survey, a question or a statement. Including a message on a dorm door is an efficient way to communicate with neighbors or passersby, without having to be face-to-face.

Within our collection, the majority of doors with messages come from Forest. Many of these are a question or survey that request participation from other floor members or visitors. Forest Door 2 has a message board saying "Draw a pretty picture!" which allows people to share a fun image that can spread positivity or laughter to onlookers or to the room owners themselves.

In the image above, there is a countdown to Spring Break that was at 20 days when the picture was taken. As a passerby myself on this floor, I saw this countdown decrease every day, and it now shows the amount of days until school is out. The effect of this message is that it spreads enthusiasm about the upcoming break among peers. It also helps people realize that they are already in the homestretch, especially if they hadn't been aware of it before.


Overall, message boards can be a powerful tool for fostering connectivity and positivity in a community by providing a space for people to share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences with one another. Through decorations on a dorm door, individuals can create a personalized space that reflects their identity and style, while also providing a creative outlet for expressing themselves. This can connect floor members who have similar interests and styles, while building a more cohesive community.
