This exhibition features 15 pictures of dorm doors, taken from four dorms across several floors. The images were organized by the type of content displayed on the door, whether that be images, a message, an object, or a mixture of the three. The purpose of this website is to show how students at IU use their door to express themselves and to connect with their peers and other passerbys. The conclusion of this project was that the motive of the door decorator matched up with the experience the onlooker had with the door, proving that the decorations truly connect students with each other.
