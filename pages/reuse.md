The metadata table we used for our exhibition can be reused for other projects. It can be expanded on by adding more dorm door images from other universities. With this addition, the audience will be able to see how dorm door decorations vary across different universities. A new column can also be added evaulating the differences between dorm doors at IU and dorm doors elsewhere.

Our metadata table can be expanded on by adding more rows and additional columns. The first column is the "pid" column. This column contains the file name of the images that are wanted to be displayed in the exhibition. The second column is the "label" column, where the title of the image can be created. To follow our organization, we named our images "Resident Hall Name Door #". The third column is the "date" column where it can be recorded the date the image was taken. The next column is the "object_type" column where the images can be sorted by how they are decorated. We sorted ours by message, image, and object, however new categories can be added if other universities decorate their doors differently. The next column is "location", where the location that the image was capture can be written. The next column is the "description" column. In this column, the images can be described by what is shown on the doors. The last column is the "quotes" column. We conducted interviews with the owners of the doors we took pictures of and a quote from the interview that best describes the image. This is how our metadata table can be utilized for future exhibitions.
