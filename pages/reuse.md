The metadata table we used for our exhibition can be reused for other projects. It can be expanded upon by adding more dorm door images from other residence halls within IU or from other universities. With this addition, the audience will be able to see how dorm door decorations vary across different universities. A new column can also be added evaulating the differences between dorm doors at IU and dorm doors elsewhere.

Our metadata table can be expanded on by adding more rows and additional columns. The first column is the "pid" column. This column contains the file name of the images that will be displayed in the exhibition. The second column is the "label" column, where the title of the image can be created. To be organized, we named our images "Resident Hall Name Door #". The third column is the "date" column, where the date the image was taken can be recorded. The next column is the "object_type" column, where the images can be sorted by how they are decorated. We sorted ours by message, image, and object. However, new categories can be added if other universities decorate their doors differently. The next column is "location", where the location that the image was captured can be written. The next column is the "description" column. In this column, the images can be described by what is shown on the doors. The last column is the "quotes" column. We conducted interviews with the owners of the doors included in our exhibition and took a quote from the interview that best describes the image. This is how our metadata table can be utilized for future exhibitions.
