Our project focuses on the subject of dorm doors, specifically why students decide to decorate their dorm doors. We took pictures of different dorm door decorations we found around IU and interviewed some of the students whose doors were included. There were many different reasons for why a student decided to decorate their doors- some wanted to decorate to celebrate a specific holiday (i.e. hearts for Valentineâ€™s Day) while others wanted to use it as a way to connect with people on their floor. Dorm door decorations give students a blank canvas to express and introduce themselves to a whole floor of people they may have never met before. For some, the way their dorm door is decorated may be a way for them to be recognized by others on their floor or even be an opportunity for conversation with someone new. Dorm door decorations attract the attention of everyone on the floor because these are decorations they walk past everyday when you walk down the halls.  Dorm doors have become an interesting topic of conversation that we wanted to explore more in our project. 

From the data collected, we found that the majority of people we observed decorated their doors with message boards and/or images. This shows that people use their dorm doors to show their interests with different images and connect with the community by writing on their message boards different surveys or updates on their life. Passersby can interact with doors by responding to surveys or writing their own messages for the door owner. We found through our interviews that students generally received the same message that the door owners were trying to send.
