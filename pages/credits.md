The Dorm Doors Decoration Project was creadted by Allison Myers who did the collaboration memo, Cole Bradfield who was the technologist, and Zoë Wilson who was the producer. This was an assignment for our class and our instructor Yilin La for SP23: INTRO TO POPULAR CULTURE: 9314. This is also for any other students or people outside of the class.
